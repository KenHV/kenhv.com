BSNL-provided routers are bad. They are horribly slow, have poor range, and are not very secure. Their routers cost â‚¹3,000. For the same price, you can get much better hardware. Here's how to set up BSNL FTTH with your own hardware.

## Requirements

- ONU ([TP-Link XZ000-G7 XPON ONU](https://www.amazon.in/dp/B0CYQDZ8NC))
- Router ([TP-Link Archer C6 AC1200 Router](https://www.amazon.in/dp/B07GVR9TG7))
- VLAN ID
- PPPoE username (password is always `password`)
- MAC address of the old router (if you have one)

## ONU Configuration

Connect to your ONU using an ethernet cable. The TP-Link ONU doesn't have a DHCP server by default, so you'll have to configure IP assignment manually. Follow these [instructions for Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/change-tcp-ip-settings-bd0a07af-15f5-cd6a-363f-ca2b6f391ace). On Linux, you can do this from NetworkManager settings.

| IP Address  | `192.168.1.100` |
| Subnet Mask | `255.255.255.0` |
| Gateway     | `192.168.1.1`   |

Now go to [192.168.1.1](http://192.168.1.1), set a password for your ONU, and log in. Go to Advanced, Network, and select VLAN Settings. Set "VLAN mode" to "VLAN TAG mode", enter your VLAN ID, and set "Priority" to `1`. You can also turn on the DHCP server if you want easier access to your ONU in the future. You can now disconnect the ethernet and connect your ONU to the router.

## Router Configuration

Connect to the router using ethernet or Wi-Fi. TP-Link also has an app to configure routers, you can use it if you like. Go to [192.168.0.1](http://192.168.0.1) and go through the setup process. Set your connection type to PPPoE and enter your PPPoE username and password (password is `password`). If you're migrating from another router, you'll need to change your new router's MAC address to the old one. Go to Advanced, Network, Internet, set "Router MAC Address" to "Use Custom MAC Address", then enter your old MAC address. Finally, you need to configure MTU. Go to Advanced, Network, Internet, Advanced Settings, and change your MTU value to `1492`. BSNL caps MTU to 1492 across India.
